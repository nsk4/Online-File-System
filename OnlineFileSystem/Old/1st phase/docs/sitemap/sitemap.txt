I decided for wide hierarchical web site organization. The main reason for selecting this approach is because my web site focuses around one main action and that is keeping files online. All main actions like file management and folder management are focused around that. On main page user has ability to access everything he needs with as few clicks as possible hence the use of wide hierarchical organisation is very useful.
